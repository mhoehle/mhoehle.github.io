<p>We present experiences from organizing a small R hackathon aimed at
advancing knowledge and documentation of the R package surveillance. The
hackathon was piggybacked on the ESCAIDE2016 conference visited by
current and potential package users in the area of infectious disease
epidemiology. The output of the hackathon is available at <a

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>A <strong><a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon">hackathon</a></strong> is
a extreme-programming sprint-like event where people involved in
software development (and beyond) meet for a short period of time with
the purpose of collaborative programming, typically in the context of
<strong><a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software">open-source
software</a></strong>. The word hackathon is a merger of
<strong>hack</strong> and <strong>marathon</strong>, where <a
href="http://www.dictionary.com/browse/hack"><em>hacking</em></a> is to
be understood as the skillful modification of computer programs (and not
the malicious circumvention of security measures). Lots of good guides
have been written on <a href="https://hackathon.guide/">how to run a
successful Hackathon</a>. In the area of <strong>infectious disease
epidemiology</strong>, which has been the main area of motivation for
our statistical developments and implementations, very successful events
(<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/hackoutwiki/home">hackout</a>,
<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/hackout2/">hackout2</a>, <a
href="http://hackout3.ropensci.org/">hackout3</a>) have previously been
organized. At a much smaller scale we wanted to ignite the energy and
enthusiasm such an event spawns.</p>
<p>As a consequence, this blog post gathers our experiences from
organising a small <strong>4x3 hackathon</strong> (4 people, 3 days) for
the surveillance R-package in connection with the <a
href="http://ecdc.europa.eu/en/escaide/Pages/ESCAIDE.aspx">ESCAIDE2016</a>
conference in November 2016. Our hope is that these experiences might be
useful for others - even if working in very different contexts.</p>
<h2 id="organizing-and-running-the-hackathon">Organizing and Running the
Hackathon</h2>
<p>We report on a number of practical “?” and “!” below.</p>
<h3 id="why">Why?</h3>
<p>Over the last several years we worked on a package for the
visualization, modelling and monitoring of surveillance time series. As
most of us are busy with other tasks now, it felt like a good idea to
all meet in person to work a little on the package and network with
potential users in order to increase awareness of the package. The 10’th
European Scientific Conference on Applied Infectious Disease
Epidemiology (<a
href="http://ecdc.europa.eu/en/escaide/Pages/ESCAIDE.aspx">ESCAIDE2016</a>)
organized by the <a href="http://ecdc.europa.eu">European Centre for
Disease Prevention and Control</a> (ECDC) in Stockholm, Sweden, 28-30
Nov 2016, with its about 600 participants, felt like the right place to
be.</p>
<h3 id="a-cool-name">A Cool Name?</h3>
<p>Stockholm is placed on the 59th parallel north, hence, during end of
November daylight is limited to approximately <a
href="http://www.timeanddate.com/sun/sweden/stockholm">6:30 hours</a>.
In other words: Perfect hacking conditions. In order to honour this,
<strong>Hack in the Dark</strong> became our internal handle for the
hackathon.</p>
<h3 id="who">Who?</h3>
<p>Hackathons come in all sizes. We decided on a mini four person
hackathon of experienced R users, who all knew the package well: two
former Ph.D. students who had used the package as the implementational
repository for their methodological developments (one of them now being
the package maintainer), a former power-user of the package and the
package creator. Alternatively, we could have involved new persons in
order to expand awareness of the package and increase diversity of the
hackathonians, but we decided to go for the small team in order to
maximize efficiency.</p>
<h3 id="venue">Venue?</h3>
<p>Piggybacking on an existing conference held in a large conference
centre meant we did not have to worry about WLAN, food and seating.
Especially when only being 4 persons.</p>
<h3 id="what-to-do">What to do?</h3>
<p>We started about 8 weeks before the hackathon to brainstorm using <a
href="https://slack.com/">slack</a> as a messaging system. We then
created a priority matrix in <a href="http://docs.google.com">google
docs</a> allowing each of the participants to prioritize the ideas. This
gave us an initial idea of what we wanted to do. Unfortunately, most of
us then got pretty busy with other activities so we never managed to
revisit the matrix until a couple of days before the start of the
hackathon. Instead, we recapitulated matters in an “indian buffet
process” meeting in Stockholm at the night before the hackathon:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Write i/o tutorials explaining how to get data into the package and
then use package functions for cool visualizations of the data</li>
<li>Use open European data for the tutorials - the theme of ESCAIDE2016
was after all: <strong>Data for action</strong></li>
<li>Make a <a href="https://shiny.rstudio.com/">shiny app</a> to
visualize the effect of various parameters choices for the surveillance
algorithms implemented in the package. The best choice of configuration
has been a recurrent user question throughout the years.</li>
<li>Demo twitter surveillance by monitoring the conference hashtag
<code>#ESCAIDE2016</code>.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="source-code-management">Source Code Management?</h3>
<p>We chose to create an organization <strong>surveillancer</strong> on
<a href="http://www.github.com">github</a>, which we then all joined
with our individual github accounts. All new projects were then
conducted by initiating new repositories. The <code>surveillance</code>
package itself is still developed on <a
href="http://www.r-forge.r-project.org">R-Forge</a> using
<code>svn</code>, but since we knew most of our work would be
<em>using</em> the surveillance package rather than <em>developing</em>
the package, we decided to keep the existing infrastructure for the
package and instead develop the planned tutorials and visualizations in
a new github project. This worked ok, but switching between
<code>svn</code> and <code>git</code> for commits on different projects
was not always helpful: <code>git commit -a</code> is a useful friend if
you don’t know the <a href="https://githowto.com/staging_changes">git
staging area</a>…</p>
<h3 id="project-output-format">Project Output Format?</h3>
<p>We decided to create an R package and then use Hadley Wickham’s new
<a href="https://hadley.github.io/pkgdown/">pkgdown</a> package to
create a website containing all hackathon output. The above specified
tutorials were then created as vignettes. An immediate advantage of this
approach was that all hackathon output was bundled and that vignette
code was directly available for the interested user.</p>
<h3 id="demo-demo-demo">Demo, demo, demo!</h3>
<p>Inspired by the extreme programming paradigm, and because we wanted
to interact with the conference, we decided to demo at least once a day
by posting hackathon output on twitter. Besides the outgoing publicity
we also frequently demo’ed internally in order to get input and
suggestions. This worked pretty well - there is nothing as motivating
and interactive as getting constructive input and suggestions from your
table neighbour!</p>
<p>Interaction with the other conference participants, on the other
hand, was moderate. We showed parts and pieces to interested people, but
in hindsight we should have aimed for a poster presentation or a related
activity in order to generate more real-life awareness of the hackathon
outside the virtual world of twitter.</p>
<h2 id="summing-up">Summing Up</h2>
<p>The three days of hackathon passed quickly, but we managed to get the
four formulated outputs done.</p>
<p>Intense software sprints are hard work, thus, it was natural that
towards the end of the hackathon the concentration decreased slightly.
However, phases of intense coding are perfectly supplemented by
listening to scientific talks, talking to former colleagues visting the
conference or sharing the passion of R with others working in the field.
In particular it was nice to exchange ideas with <a
href="http://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/t.jombart">Thibaut Jombart</a>,
whose <a href="http://www.repidemicsconsortium.org/">R Epidemics
Consortium (RECON)</a> project hopefully is able to bundle the R
initiatives in infectious disease epidemiology a little. Besides the
availability of software, the training aspect of new users (e.g. trainee
epidemiologists) is also crucial. Finally, the
<strong>aftermath</strong> of the hackathon is as important as the
pre-event planning: dedicated coordinators have to ensure that loose
ends are wrapped up. Here, the participants’ enthusiasm declines quickly
as other activities become higher priorities. Again, it’s essential to
have a clear goal of what needs to be done (e.g. a blog entry…).</p>
<p>Altogether, code sessions such as a <a
href="http://staff.math.su.se/hoehle/blog/2016/08/04/outbreakEnd.html">reproducibility
session</a> or a <strong>toolbox session</strong> could be components
for spicing up scientific conferences. For example the toolbox event
could consist of a set of interested people, who on conference day 1
decide to implement a particular method useful in practice, and then
demo it on the last day. Obviously, all these suggestions take time away
from other conference content and certainly are more stressful than
dozing of in the plenary sessions…</p>
<p>No matter what, focus of a hackathon should also be on social
aspects. It also proves wise not to ignore fresh air &amp; sunlight
completely. To our surprise, the 6:30 hours of daylight were at times
actually quite sunny in Stockholm!</p>

<p>In order to run the accompanying code (available from github by
clicking on the “fork me on github” icons), version 1.13.0 of the
<code>surveillance</code> package is needed (available from CRAN). As an
