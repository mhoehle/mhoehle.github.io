<p>We use the <code>RMariaDB</code> and <code>dbplyr</code> packages to
analyze the results database of the World Cubing Association. In
particular we are interested in finding unofficial world records of
fastest 3x3x3 solves, countries with large proportion of female cubers
as well as acceptable solving times before entering a WCA
competition.</p>

<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>An item on my bucket list of
irrelevant-things-to-excel-in-during-parental-leave™ is to solve the
Rubik’s cube again. In 2013 I learned the <a
href="http://starlingsroost.asuscomm.com/cubestation/index.php?page=3x3x3/beginner/step1"><strong>beginner’s
method</strong></a> for solving the cube by reading <a
href="https://www.speedsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Dan_Harris">Dan
Harris’</a> <em>Speedsolving the Cube</em> book. However, any attempts
to improve times by learning <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CFOP_Method">CFOP</a> failed
miserably in 2013 due to lack of time. So in this 2019 attempt I just
try to revoke my beginner’s method and improve it slightly by <a
href="https://www.cubeskills.com/tutorials/4-look-last-layer">4LL</a>.
Nevertheless, my solves fluctuate at 120-180s. This has made me worry
about the shame-factor of pulling through the next item on the bucket
list: competing in a <a
href="https://www.worldcubeassociation.org">World Cubing Association
(WCA)</a> 3x3x3 competition. The motivating question of this post is
therefore: how large a <strong>skill outlier</strong> would one be at
such a competition with, say, an 180s average?</p>
<h2 id="mining-the-world-cubing-association-database">Mining the World
Cubing Association Database</h2>
<p>Luckily, the WCA provides the results of all cubers and competitions
in a <a
href="https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/results/misc/export.html">downloadable
SQL database</a> (400 MB mySQL/MariaDB SQL text file). The downloadable
version of 19 Apr 2019 contains tables with information on all 124,997
players, 6,014 competitions as well as the 2,130,374 results obtained by
players in competitions starting with the <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4qoeJMPv0Y">Rubik’s Cube World
Championship in 1982</a>. Not <strong>big data</strong>, but big enough
and structured in a way that justifies using a SQL database backend for
the analysis instead of just a flat <code>data.frame</code> in R.</p>
<p>With a little bit of effort, one installs a <a
href="https://mariadb.org">MariaDB</a> together with the <a
href="https://downloads.mariadb.org/connector-c/">MariaDB
Connector/C</a> and imports the WCA data into the database.
Subsequently, the <code>RMariaDB</code> <span class="citation"
data-cites="rmariadb">(Müller et al. 2018)</span> and <code>DBI</code>
<span class="citation" data-cites="DBI">(R Special Interest Group on
Databases (R-SIG-DB), Wickham, and Müller 2018)</span> R packages allow
one to connect directly to the DB. Furthermore, the <code>dbplyr</code>
<span class="citation" data-cites="dbplyr">(Wickham and Ruiz
2019)</span> package allows one to write <code>dplyr</code> code, which
is then translated into and evaluated as SQL queries behind the
scenes.</p>
<p>We connect to the database as follows:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">library</span>(DBI)</span>
<span id="cb1-2"><a href="#cb1-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">library</span>(RMariaDB)</span>
<span id="cb1-3"><a href="#cb1-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>con <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> DBI<span class="sc">::</span><span class="fu">dbConnect</span>(RMariaDB<span class="sc">::</span><span class="fu">MariaDB</span>(), <span class="at">group=</span><span class="st">&quot;my-db&quot;</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>where, as suggested in the <a
href="https://mariadb.com/kb/en/library/configuring-mariadb-with-option-files/"><code>RMariaDB</code>
package documentation</a>, <code>my-db</code> is a custom group defined
in the option file <code>~/my.cnf</code> containing the user, password,
protocol type and the database to use (<code>wca</code>). This is
preferred instead of calling <code>dbConnect</code> with options such as
<code>socket</code>, <code>user</code>, <code>password</code> and
<code>dbname</code>.</p>
<p>To import the data one can either open a <code>mysql</code> shell and
type SQL commands or send the SQL query from R to the database:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre
class="sourceCode sql"><code class="sourceCode sql"><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="kw">SOURCE</span> WCA_export.sql;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>After such an import we can view the contents of the database:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb3-1"><a href="#cb3-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">dbListTables</span>(con)</span></code></pre></div>

##  [4] &quot;RoundTypes&quot;                              &quot;Rounds&quot;                                  &quot;Competitions&quot;                           
##  [7] &quot;Continents&quot;                              &quot;Persons&quot;                                 &quot;championships&quot;                          
## [10] &quot;Events&quot;                                  &quot;Scrambles&quot;                               &quot;RanksAverage&quot;

<p>Of particular interest is the <code>Results</code> table, where each
row contains the results of a player (<code>personId</code>) in a round
of a WCA competition of events such as the 2x2x2, 3x3x3, 4x4x4, etc. For
the <a
href="https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/files/WCA_Competition_Tutorial.pdf">3x3x3
event</a> each round consist of five solves solves
(<code>values1</code>-<code>values5</code>) of which the best is
reported in the column <code>best</code> and the trimmed mean (removing
the best and worst solve and computing the mean of the three other
solves) is reported in the column <code>average</code>.</p>
<pre><code>##  [1] &quot;competitionId&quot;         &quot;eventId&quot;               &quot;roundTypeId&quot;           &quot;pos&quot;                   &quot;best&quot;                  &quot;average&quot;              
##  [7] &quot;personName&quot;            &quot;personId&quot;              &quot;personCountryId&quot;       &quot;formatId&quot;              &quot;value1&quot;                &quot;value2&quot;               
## [13] &quot;value3&quot;                &quot;value4&quot;                &quot;value5&quot;                &quot;regionalSingleRecord&quot;  &quot;regionalAverageRecord&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Furthermore, the table <code>Persons</code>contains additional basic
information about each player:</p>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;id&quot;        &quot;subid&quot;     &quot;name&quot;      &quot;countryId&quot; &quot;gender&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Note: At WCA competitions there is no separate ranking according to
gender.</p>
<p>After getting initially acquainted with the database, we do two small
SQL-side modifications. The first modification is to create an index for
the tables, which will help to substantially reduce the join times later
on. The second is to merge the separate year, month, day columns of the
event day in the <code>Competitions</code> table into a single ISO 8601
date. See the <a
href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hoehleatsu/hoehleatsu.github.io/master/_source/2019-05-06-wcamining.Rmd">github
code</a> for details.</p>
<p>As the next step we create tables to use with <code>dbplyr</code>.
These will then just dispatch to the database tables. For now, we work
only with the results of the 3x3x3 cubes, but will join the Results,
Persons and Competitions table in order to get relevant information
about gender of the person as well as date of the solve together with
the time of each solve.</p>

<p>Note that <code>dbplyr</code> uses lazy evaluation, i.e. calls are
not executed before needed. However, one can with
<code>show_query</code> check the SQL call, which is used in case of
evaluation. In this example the SQL query to get the results of female
cubers, i.e.:</p>

<p>Note that the solve times are given in centiseconds (i.e. 1/100’th of
a second). The above result can be compare with the corresponding
information at <a
href="https://wcadb.net/rankings.php?region=World&amp;events=333&amp;gender=female&amp;show=100&amp;type=single">https://wcadb.net</a>.</p>
As professional data scientist one knows how important it is to
understand the data generating process and to know your data. So this is
how the 5.37s solve by Dana Yi in 2017 looks like:

<h3 id="the-evolution-of-the-3x3x3-single-solve-wr">The evolution of the
3x3x3 single solve WR</h3>
<p>So at this point we force an execution of the <code>allResults</code>
query and cache the result as an object in R. This feels slightly
disappointing, because the hope was to leave the data in the database
management system (DBMS) as long as possible, but it felt like the most
efficient way to compute sequential ranks - however, it might have been
possible to perform the sequential rank directly using SQL statements,
although I did not succeed to find the correct approach within the
available time <a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Instead, the results are sorted according to their date in R and
subsequently each result is checked to see if it’s sequential rank is 1,
i.e. whether the time is lower than all previous results. For this
purpose a fast Rcpp function <code>sequential_is_rank1</code> function
is provided, which computes the sequential rank of a vector of values
(see <a
href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hoehleatsu/hoehleatsu.github.io/master/_source/2019-05-06-wcamining.Rmd">github
code</a> for details). Note: If we had not pulled the data into R at
this point, such a computation within R would not have been
possible.</p>
<p>The evolution of the world record for males and females over time is
then easily plotted. Note: As mentioned WCA doesn’t officially
distinguish between male and female results.</p>

Is such a plot useful? Not really IMHO, but I had seen a similar plot at
the <a
href="https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/results/misc/evolution/">WCA
webpage</a>, so it’s nice to be able to create it in R.</p>
<h3 id="countries-with-highest-proportion-of-female-cubers">Countries
with highest proportion of female cubers</h3>
<p>Since the overall fraction of female cubers is around 10%, we
determine the top-5 countries (with at least 50 cubers), having the
highest proportion of female cubers in the <code>Persons</code>
database:</p>

<p>I find this list quite surprising and also encouraging!</p>
<h3 id="skill-level-before-entering-a-wca-competition">Skill level
before entering a WCA competition</h3>
<p>Getting back to the motivating question of this post, we derive for
each result how experienced the cuber was at the time of obtaining the
result. We shall measure experience terms of years since the cuber’s
first WCA competition. Special interest will then be in results of
cubers in their very first WCA competition - see the <a
href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hoehleatsu/hoehleatsu.github.io/master/_source/2019-05-06-wcamining.Rmd">github
code</a> for details.</p>
<p>We then use this information to create a scatter plot with result
average (in seconds) and corresponding experience of the cuber (in
years). For better visualization we plot the marginal 5%, 10%, 50%, 90%,
95% quantiles as smooth function of experience - this is done with with
<code>ggplot2</code>’s <code>geom_quantile</code> function together with
the argument <code>method="rqss"</code>, which then uses the
<code>rqss</code> function of the <code>quantreg</code> package <span
class="citation" data-cites="quantreg">(Koenker 2018)</span> to compute
smooth quantile curves:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/figure/source/2019-05-06-wcamining/QUANTILEAVG-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />
We notice that the quantile curves stay more or less parallel, which is
indicative of a stable variance and skewness of the results over the
range of experiences. Focusing only on the round-1 results of those
participating for the first time in the period from 2018-04-19 to
2019-04-19 we see that the quantiles for the average is (in seconds)
are:</p>
<pre><code>##    5%   10%   50%   90%   95%   99% 99.9% 
##    16    19    36    77    93   136   208</code></pre>
<p>This shows that with a 180s average one is located at the 99.7%
quantile of all cubers entering a WCA competition. In other words: if
the comfort zone is defined as <strong>being within the 95%
envelope</strong>, then a ~90s average is needed before entering a WCA
competition.</p>
<p>To further investigate, how cubers of that skill level evolve in
time, we study the solving skills of cubers entering their first WCA
competition with a solve time between 180s and 240s. In order to reduce
the potential effect of secular trends due to, e.g., better cubes, we
consider the skill evolution of the cohort of <strong>first time
cubers</strong> from 2015 and onwards.</p>
<p>The cohort inclusion criterion provide a total of 168 first time
competitors in this skill bracket. Only 28.0% of these cubers decide to
participate in further WCA competitions! The further development of the
averages of these cubers is best shown in a trajectory plot. Note that
the end of the lines does not necessarily mean that they stopped cubing,
instead it could be due to right truncation, because only competitions
until 2019-04-19 are available.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/figure/source/2019-05-06-wcamining/TRAJPLOT-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />
Instead of the trajectories we can also overlay an expectation smoother
on top of the data to see how the expected average progresses with time
in the cohort. Note, that this portrays the marginal expectation and
thus is only based on cubers, who are still cubing at that time. No
adjustment for any, potentially informative, drop-out is made.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/figure/source/2019-05-06-wcamining/TRAJSMOOTHED-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>From the figure we notice a rapid improvement the first 6 months
after entering the first WCA competition. Hereafter results only improve
slowly.</p>
<h2 id="discussion">Discussion</h2>
<p>Through analysis of the WCA results database it became clear that
participating in a 3x3x3 event with a 180s average <del>is uncool</del>
<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> does not take you to winners’
rostrum <a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>. The data also show that cubers
entering the world of WCA competitions with such an average are likely
to never participate in another WCA event. In case they do, their times
drop to 90-120s averages within 6 months after which they are stuck - it
is very unlikely that they will crack the 20s barrier. To conclude: In
my situation it seems wise to practice more, before going to the first
WCA competition. 😃</p>
<p>From a data science perspective this post provided insights on using
<code>dbplyr</code> as a tidyverse frontend for SQL queries. Being an
SQL novice, I learned that generating indexes is a <em>must</em>, if you
do not want to wait forever for your <em>INNER JOIN</em>s. Furthermore,
I ran into some trouble with mutates and filters with the package,
because the produced SQL code provide empty results. It remains unclear
to me if this was due to differences in SQL DBMSs (e.g. MariaDB being
differnet from PostGres), my lack of SQL knowledge or if it’s a
shortcoming of the <code>dbplyr</code> package. My conclusion is that
performing the data wrangling within the DBMS was overkill for the
medium sized wca data. For larger or more structured datasets such an
approach can, however, be fruitful, because a DBMS’s main purpose is to
provide efficient solutions for working with your data. Furthermore, I
like the idea of having a familiar dplyr frontend and just auto-generate
an efficient backend code (here: SQL) to do the actual wrangling. This
also provides an opportunity to get an outside-R-implementation, which
can be an important aspect in <a

assurance of statistical analyses</a>.</p>
