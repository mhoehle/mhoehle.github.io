<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>All-cause mortality is one of indicators used to measure the impact
of the COVID-19 pandemic, because this indicator is less biased by the
testing strategy needed to identify cases to have died while having a
recent COVID-19 diagnosis. Since both death and COVID-19 have a strong
age component, it appears crucial to take an age-stratified view on both
all-cause mortality as well as deaths associated with COVID-19. This
will also help to put age-related COVID-19 mortality in a bigger
picture.</p>
<h2 id="age-stratified-mortality">Age Stratified Mortality</h2>
<p>Real-time mortality monitoring is not common in Germany, as can be
seen from the coverage of the <a
href="https://www.euromomo.eu/">EuroMoMo monitoring</a> for Germany,
where only the two federal states Hesse and Berlin participate. However,
as part of the COVID-19 response, the Federal Statistical Office
(Destatis) now provides weekly updated <a
href="https://www.destatis.de/DE/Themen/Querschnitt/Corona/Gesellschaft/kontextinformationen-gesellschaft.html#Sterbe">preliminary
mortality statistics of all-cause mortality in 2020</a>. The methodology
behind the numbers as well as age-stratified additional analyses are
described in an accompanying <a
href="https://www.destatis.de/DE/Methoden/WISTA-Wirtschaft-und-Statistik/2020/04/sonderauswertung-sterbefallzahlen-042020.pdf?__blob=publicationFile">publication</a>
<span class="citation" data-cites="zurnieden_etal2020">(zur Nieden,
Sommer, and Lüken 2020)</span>. The age-stratified analyses are
unfortunately not continuously updated, however, up-to-date data are
made publicly <a
href="https://www.destatis.de/DE/Themen/Gesellschaft-Umwelt/Bevoelkerung/Sterbefaelle-Lebenserwartung/Tabellen/sonderauswertung-sterbefaelle.html?nn=209016">available</a>.</p>
<p>
<center>
<img src="/blog/figure/source/2020-12-28-mort/destatis.png" width="550">
</center>
<p>The reported COVID-19 associated deaths (by week of death) are
obtained from an <a
href="https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuartiges_Coronavirus/Projekte_RKI/COVID-19_Todesfaelle.html">export
of the RKI</a>. However, the COVID-19 deaths are not available in
age-stratified form. Furthermore, in order to compensate for reporting
delays of deaths, the Destatis analysis only goes until 4 weeks before
the time point of analysis, i.e. the 2020-12-18 version shown in the
above image only reaches ISO week 47 (spanning the time period
2020-11-16 - 2020-11-22).</p>
<p>The aim of the present blog post is to provide an <strong>up-to-date
age-stratified view including COVID-19 associated deaths</strong>. As
additional data source we use the age-stratified cumulative number of
deaths reported every Tuesday in the RKI <a
href="https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuartiges_Coronavirus/Situationsberichte/Dez_2020/2020-12-22-en.pdf?__blob=publicationFile">situational
report</a> (p.7).</p>
<h2 id="data-io">Data I/O</h2>
<p>This section consists of data wrangling the above mentioned data
sources. One challenge is for example to align the age classes used in
the different sources. See the R code on <a
href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hoehleatsu/hoehleatsu.github.io/master/_source/2020-12-28-mort.Rmd">GitHub</a>
for the gory details.</p>
<h2 id="up-to-date-age-stratified-all-cause-mortality">Up-to-date
age-stratified all-cause mortality</h2>
<p>Available all-cause deaths (by week of death) are available until
2020-W47. Note that Destatis stresses the <a
href="https://twitter.com/FlorianBurg2/status/1343903541849681922?s=20">preliminary
character of the data</a> - the numbers might change as further deaths
arrive. Stratified by age the times series for 2020 compared to the
years 2016-2019 looks as follows - please beware of the different y-axes
for the age-groups in the plot:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/figure/source/2020-12-28-mort/AGEMORT-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>Since the age-groups also contain different population sizes, a
better comparison between age-groups instead of absolute numbers is by
<a
href="/blog/figure/source/2020-12-28-mort/sterbefaelle_incidence.png">incidence
rate</a> (i.e. deaths per 100,000 population in the age group). To
underline the age-gradient of mortality: 56% of the deaths 2016-2019
occured in the age group of 80+ years (90% in the age group of 60+). It
becomes clear that 2020 mortality in the 80+ age groups was rather low
during the first 10-12 weeks and then had a spike in connection with the
first COVID-19 wave (March-April). Subsequently, a summer peak (possibly
associated with heat) is followed by an increasing and ongoing upward
trend. One challenge for a statistical analysis of these numbers is to
figure out how much of the upwards trend is “catch-up mortality” due to
the lower mortality in the beginning of the year and how much is excess
related to COVID-19.</p>
<p>An initial analysis of this question consists of summing the
all-cause mortalities from W1 until W47 for 2020 (observed) and compare
this to the summation of the weekly mean of 2016-2019 for the
corresponding time period (expected)<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>. When we do this by
age-group we obtain:</p>

<p>
<p>So in these numbers the mild mortality in the older age groups during
the first weeks balances some, but not all, of the excess in these
age-groups since Mar-Apr. The total proportion of 2020-W1 to 2020-W47
mortalities in the 80+ age group is currently 58%. However, it is also
important to realize that the current observed 2020 numbers contain the
consequences of all type of effects from the pandemic management, which
includes changes in the population behavior due to interventions.
Disentangling the complex effects of all-cause mortality and the
COVID-19 pandemic is a delicate matter, which takes experts in several
disciplines (demographers, statisticians, epidemiologists) to solve.
However, should you based on the above numbers happen to think that
COVID-19 is not a serious problem, it is insightful to think about the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevention_paradox">prevention
paradox</a> and take a look at the <a
href="https://www.ft.com/content/a2901ce8-5eb7-4633-b89c-cbdf5b386938">all-cause
mortality statistics</a> from other countries.</p>
<h3 id="all-cause-mortality-and-covid-19-associated-deaths">All-Cause
Mortality and COVID-19 Associated Deaths</h3>
<p>To see, how much of the all-cause mortality is directly contributed
by deaths in association with COVID-19, we match the age-stratified
all-cause mortality data with the age-stratified COVID-19 deaths
reported by the RKI since Sep 2020 (2020-W35). One complication of this
matching is that the RKI deaths are reported by the week that the
information about the death reached the RKI and not the week of death.
In order to match it with the Destatis all-cause mortality time series,
we extrapolate week of death from the week of report by the simple
assumption that the death occurred 2 weeks before the report<a
href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, to avoid a downward bias in the observed numbers by
observed-but-not-yet-reported deaths, the previously shown Destatis
analyses of all-cause mortality does not include the most recent weeks,
where COVID-19 associated mortality increased substantially in Germany:
the analysis is only done until 2020-W47, even though the date of
analysis was 2020-12-18. At this time the RKI in their situational
report of 2020-12-22 already reported a total of 26964 COVID-19
associated deaths - only 15686 have their time of death up to 2020-W47.
We thus expect the reported excess mortality to increase within the
coming weeks. As a simple extrapolation, we assume that all COVID-19
associated mortality in the subsequent weeks above the level in
2020-W47, is directly summable to the 2020 all-cause mortality<a
href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>. With this simple extrapolation, the
excess mortality computations can be extended until 2020-W50 and leads
to the following predictions:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/figure/source/2020-12-28-mort/AGEMORTWCOVID-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>We note that the COVID-19 associated deaths in the most recent weeks
in the 80+ age groups make up more than <a
href="/blog/figure/source/2020-12-28-mort/deaths_covid19_proportion.png">30%
of all deaths reported on average over the years 2016-2019</a>. This
would mean an excess of mortality for the period of 2020-W01 to 2020-W50
of 5%, which is likely to increase even further as the remaining weeks
of 2020 are added<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>.</p>
<h2 id="discussion">Discussion</h2>
<p>Considering all-cause mortality and COVID-19 associated mortality as
a measure for the impact of an pandemic is a rather simplistic view of
the pandemic. COVID-19 infections can be very mild, but complicated
progressions can occur without leading to death (see, e.g., <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_COVID">long COVID</a>). Looking
at mortality also ignores the complex interplay between age-groups,
where it can be beneficial to reduce infections in a
not-so-affected-by-the-disease age-group in order to protect the
higher-risk groups. The motivation of this post was primarily to put
COVID-19 associated mortality in relation to all-cause mortality in
order to get a better understanding of the daily number of COVID-19
deaths. An age-stratified view is necessary for this.</p>
<p>We showed that the Destatis reported excess-mortality are expected to
increase in the coming weeks. The extrapolations used in the present
analysis are simplistic and could be improved by a <a
href="https://staff.math.su.se/hoehle/blog/2016/07/19/nowCast.html">nowcasting
approach</a>, which extrapolates not-yet-reported deaths from knowledge
about the reporting delay <span class="citation"
