<p>Web-scraped data are used to put a Rubik’s cube competition result
into perspective. The sugarcoating consists of altering the sampling

<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>I just finished teaching an undergraduate course on <a
href="https://mt5013-ht19.github.io/">data wrangling with R</a> at
Stockholm University about the tidyverse, SQL, and web-scraping<a
href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>. Inspired by Jenny Bryan’s <a
href="https://happygitwithr.com/classroom-overview.html">STAT545
course</a> the course used GitHub as communication platform. Similar to
the userR! <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_talk">lightning talks</a>,
each student had to pitch their project work in a 5 minute presentation
in order to woo other students to read their report. I was utterly
amazed by the content of the reports and the creativity of the
presentations, which included sung slide titles, shiny apps,
cliffhangers, and much more. Enabling mathematics students to pull their
own data gives them a power to realize ideas and test hypothesis that
were not possible before! Most of the students did web-scraping or API
calls to get their data. Since I - thanks to support by two TAs - never
got around to implement any scraping myself, a blog post feels like the
right way to catch up on this.</p>
<p>After finishing last place in the <a
href="https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/competitions/BerlinWinterCubing2020">Berlin
Winter Cubing 2020</a> competition, there was an acute need to sugarcoat
the result. The aim of the post is thus to substantiate that this last
place was purely due to lack of competitors. 😃 Since at the time of the
analysis, my results were not yet part of the <a
href="https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/results/misc/export.html">World
Cube Association (WCA) results database</a>, the idea was to use
web-scraping from the live feed to pull my results and compare them to
the database. The resulting R code is available from <a
href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hoehleatsu/hoehleatsu.github.io/master/_source/2020-01-22-wcascrape.Rmd">github</a>
and is described below.</p>
<h2 id="scraping-wca-live-results">Scraping WCA live results</h2>
<p>WCA competition results are reported live, i.e. as they are entered,
by a dynamically generated web page. Below is shown the round 1 results
of the <a
href="%5D(https://live.worldcubeassociation.org/competitions/BerlinWinterCubing2020)">Berlin
Winter Cubing2020</a> competition. In case of the traditional Rubik’s
cube (aka. 3x3x3) event, one round of the competition consists of 5
solves. A trimmed mean is computed from the five solve times (aka. Ao5)
by removing the best and worst result and averaging the three remaining
results.</p>
<center>
<img src="/blog/figure/source/2020-01-22-wcascrape/liveresults.png">

<p>The data science job is now to automatically scrape the above results
as they become available. In other words dynamically generated pages are
to be scraped. The post <a

<p>In other words, my first (and as of today only) official 3x3x3
average is 1M 18.05S which corresponds to 7805 centiseconds. This is
much better than the 3 minutes anticipated in my <a
href="http://staff.math.su.se/hoehle/blog/2019/05/06/wcamining.html">analysis
from May 2019</a> and was well under the 4:00 time limit of the round.
Still, I finished last place in the 3x3x3 competition (rank 84/84).
However, the competition was in no way representative of my peer group
(senior newbie cubers) as, for example, number 1, 3 and 7 of the <a
href="https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/competitions/WC2019/results/all?event=333">World
Championship 2019</a> also competed.</p>
<p>The aim of this post is thus to use a data based approach to alter
the sampling frame of the comparison in order to make the comparison
more relevant (aka. sugarcoating):</p>
<ul>
<li>How does my result rank within the population of German first time
competitors?</li>
<li>How does my result rank within the population of age 40+
cubers?</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="german-first-time-competitors">German first time
competitors</h3>
<p>The <a
href="https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/results/misc/export.html">WCA
results database</a> is used to determine all 3x3x3 results by German
cubers a shown in the previous <a
href="http://staff.math.su.se/hoehle/blog/2019/05/06/wcamining.html">Speedmining
the Cubing Community with dbplyr</a> post. We perform a comparison with
the round 1 results of all German first time 3x3x3 competitors within
the last 5 years.</p>
<p>This gives us 1024 cubers to compare with and constitutes a more
relevant population of comparison than, e.g., podium contestants from
World’s 2019. The plot below shows the cumulative distribution of the
Ao5 the cubers got in round 1 of their first competition. Given a value
on the x-axis, the y-axis denotes the proportion of cubers which
obtained an average lower or equal to the selected value.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/figure/source/2020-01-22-wcascrape/CDFNEWBIE-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>From the graph it becomes clear that my time corresponds to the 94.34
percentile of the distribution, i.e. 94% of the 5 last years German
first time competitors had an average better than me in their first
competition. This means that the performance was just about within 95%
percentile of German competition newbies. Yay!</p>
<p>How do these cubers evolve after their first competition? I was
particularly interested in the trajectory of cubers within my skill
bracket, which here shall be defined as an average located between my
best and worst solve time of the round, i.e. 65.24s and 105.12s.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/figure/source/2020-01-22-wcascrape/TRAJPLOT-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>In the figure, the two horizontal lines indicate the limits of the
skill bracket and the cross denotes my average. A smooth line is fitted
to the longitudinal data, due to simplicity the smoothed fit does not
take the longitudinal data structure and the drop-out mechanisms into
account. By focusing on the cohort of cubers starting to compete within
the last 5 years induces censoring: Cubers who started with competitions
for example 1 years ago, will not be able to have results more than 1
years back in time. Still, a clear downward trend is visible, if the
cuber goes to further cubing competitions. However, only 25% of the
first time cubers have a second competition recorded in the data.
Somewhat demotivating is to see that only 3 out of the 84 first time
cubers in the skill bracket manage to obtain a sub-30s average at a
later stage.</p>
<h3 id="comparing-with-senior-cubers">Comparing with senior cubers</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.speedsolving.com/members/logiqx.17180/">Michael
George</a> maintains an <a
href="https://logiqx.github.io/wca-ipy-www/">unofficial ranking for the
senior cubing community</a> based on the WCA results database and a
voluntary registration of senior cubers. As in other sports disciplines,
“senior” is defined as aged 40+. Based on a one-time anonymised extract
from the WCA database containing the true age of the cuber, the
completeness of the self-report sample as well as a statistical
extrapolation of the true rank within the WCA 40+ population can be
computed: Around 30% of the senior cubers are contained in the
self-reported sample. The WCA id as well a personal records of all
self-reported “old-cubers” is available in <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON">JSON format</a>’ish format and
can be scraped using the <a

<p>From the response we can extract the WCA id of the self-reported
senior cubers, which we then match to the WCA database to get their
round 1 result at their first cubing competition. Note: This is a slight
approximation to the population of relevance, because the cubers could
have been younger than 40 at the time of their first WCA average.
Furthermore, note also the cohort effects as cubing times in general
have declined, e.g., due to better hardware.</p>

<p>From this it becomes clear that my average is located at the 70%
percentile of the first competition result of (self-reported) senior
cubers. Not so bad at all. How do comparable senior cubers evolve over
time? The graphic below shows how the senior 289 cubers, who
participated in their first competition within the last 5 years, evolved
over time.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/figure/source/2020-01-22-wcascrape/SENIORTRAJ-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>About 81% of these senior cubers attended more than one competition,
which is a higher proportion than in the overall cubing population, but
is likely to be explained by the sampling bias of senior cubers having
to self-report. Smoothed mean tendencies in 5 skill brackets,
i.e. cohorts of [0,30), [30, 60), [60, 90) and [90, 120) seconds Ao5 in
their first competition, are computed and visualized. The cross
indicates my Ao5 result. Interpretation of these curves is again
complicated by drop-out processes and cohort effects. Still the curves
show that if I stick to cubing, I have a good chance at becoming sub-50,
maybe even sub-40, within one year!</p>
<h2 id="discussion">Discussion</h2>
<p>It’s only logical and in the nature of competitions that somebody has
to finish last. From my previous analysis I knew this would be a risk,
but being both the age and skill outlier is still a bit of a party
pooper. On the positive side: Signing up for a competition helped me
shuffle some time free to practice, I learned how a competition works,
saw no. 1,3 and 7 from the World’s 2019 final in action and got to judge
other cubers. The statistical analyses in this post show that, by
rectifying the sampling frame to a more comparable group, results are
not so bad at all. 😃</p>
<h4 id="technical-note">Technical note</h4>
<p>I cube with a stickerless YuXin Little Magic using CFOP (F2L+4LL
accelerated with additional PLL algos). My 3x3x3 PBs at home are 46.19
(single) and 58.10 (Ao5) with scrambles generated by <a
href="cstimer.net">cstimer</a>. This illustrates that a competition, in
terms of pressure, is something else than cubing relaxed at home. In one
of the attempts I failed the T-perm twice - despite having made a <a
