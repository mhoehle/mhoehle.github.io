<p>Inspired by the recent <strong>March For Science</strong> we look
into methods for the statistical estimation of the number of people
participating in a demonstration organized as a march. In particular, we
provide R code to reproduce the <strong>two on-the-spot counting
method</strong> analysis of <span class="citation"

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Exercising your democratic right to express support for a cause by
demonstration has found anew usage. The <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_for_Science">March for
Science</a> is a recent examples of such a demonstration inspired by
recent political developments. The number of persons participating in
such marches is <em>the</em> indicator by which the support of the cause
is measured. Crowd size estimates have therefore always been subject to
political interpretation and, hence, possible politically motivated
bias. In this work we focus on what statistics has to offer with respect
to finding the <strong>true number</strong> of participants. A good
overview of this task’s challenges is given in <span class="citation"
data-cites="watson_yip2011">Watson and Yip (2011)</span>. A particular
difficulty is the size estimation of moving crowds as seen in
marches.</p>
<p>As case study we replicate the analysis of <span class="citation"
data-cites="yip_etal2010">Yip et al. (2010)</span> on estimating the
number of participants in the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong_1_July_marches#2006">1st
of July Marches</a> in Hong Kong. Since the handover to China in 1997
these marches have been conducted yearly to demonstrate for democracy
and freedom of speech in Hong Kong. Below is shown the 3.6 km long
demonstration route from <a
href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_Park_(Hongkong)">Victoria
Park</a> to Government Headquarters for the 2006 demonstration as
described by <span class="citation" data-cites="yip_etal2010">Yip et al.
(2010)</span>. A <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8WQ2TAEquxM">youtube video</a> of
the 2006 demonstration illustrates this better than words.</p>

<p>
<p>In order to estimate the number of participants a <strong>two
on-the-spot counting method</strong> was devised by <span
class="citation" data-cites="yip_etal2010">Yip et al. (2010)</span>: Two
points along the march were selected as shown in the above map: Point A
denotes the location after which an individual is counted as being part
of the march. In order to take into account that people join the march
at a later point than A, a second point B is selected to adjust the
count at A for such late entries. Three to four persons were stationed
at each of the two counting locations. Once the demonstration passed the
respective point each of them started to count the number of people
passing in a one-minute intervals. They counted for one minute every 5
minutes until the last person of the march had passed the counting
point.</p>
<h3 id="loading-the-data">Loading the Data</h3>
<p>We store the resulting counting data displayed in Table 2 and Table 3
of <span class="citation" data-cites="yip_etal2010">Yip et al.
(2010)</span> as two Excel-files. In a data pre-processing step these
are then read and combined into one data.frame containing the columns
<code>Y1</code>-<code>Y4</code>. Furthermore, we re-format the table’s
time specification to proper POSIX formatted date-times. The exact data
dancing steps can be found in the accompanying <a
href="https://github.com/hoehleatsu/hoehleatsu.github.io/blob/master/_source/2017-05-04-crowdsize.Rmd">Rmd
code of this post</a>. Altogether, this yields a <code>tbl</code> with
the first couple of lines looking as follows:</p>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 6 × 7
##      Y1    Y2    Y3    Y4     Mean Point          Time_POSIX
##   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;              &lt;dttm&gt;
## 1   150    NA   160   180 163.3333     A 2006-07-01 15:55:00
## 2   308   360   250   280 299.5000     A 2006-07-01 16:00:00
## 3   430   350   300   270 337.5000     A 2006-07-01 16:05:00
## 4   210   280   240   252 245.5000     A 2006-07-01 16:10:00
## 5   130   216   200   180 181.5000     A 2006-07-01 16:15:00
## 6   210   260   300   280 262.5000     A 2006-07-01 16:20:00</code></pre>
<p>We then compute a number of row-wise statistics for all columns
containing the counts - which columns contain the counts is specified by
a regular expression <code>ccol_regexp</code>. In our case would be
<code>"^Y[0-9]+"</code>.</p>
<h3 id="descriptive-statistics">Descriptive Statistics</h3>
<p>The counts of the 4 counters at point A and the 3 counters at point B
are summarized in the following small table:</p>
<center>

<p>
<p>A time series for the individual counts as well as their mean is
shown below. One observes that at point B the intensity of the crowd was
lower, as the observation had stretched over a larger distance. The
later is seen from the time span between the first and last count for
the two points: approximately 1:45h for A vs. 2:45h for B.</p>

<h2 id="two-on-the-spot-counting-method">Two On-the-Spot Counting
Method</h2>
<p>Below we give the mathematical details of the two on-the-spot
counting method. Consider the counting point <span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span> of the march, i.e. <span
class="math inline">\(X\in \{A,B\}\)</span>. Let <span
class="math inline">\(m_X\)</span> be the number of counters at this
point. Assume that the first people of the march pass <span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span> at time point <span
class="math inline">\(a_X\)</span> and that last people of the march
reach <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> at time point <span
class="math inline">\(e_X\)</span>. The time unit could for example be
minutes. Counting is done such that at regular intervals <span
class="math inline">\(c\)</span> one counts all people passing the point
of observation within a time block of 1 unit - say 1 minute. Let <span
class="math inline">\(k_X\)</span> denote the number of time points
where observations are available at <span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span>. Hence, the <span
class="math inline">\(k_X\)</span> observations at <span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span> are available for the time points <span
class="math inline">\(a_X,a_X+c,a_X+2c,a_X+(k_X-1)c\)</span>. Denote by
<span class="math inline">\(Y_{X,i}(t)\)</span> the <span
class="math inline">\(i\)</span>’th person’s count at time <span
class="math inline">\(t\)</span>. Then</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\overline{Y}_X(t) = \frac{1}{m_X}
\sum_{i=1}^{m_X} Y_{X,i}(t)\]</span></p>
<p>is the average of the observer’s counts at point <span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span> for time <span
class="math inline">\(t\)</span>. By scaling up each observer’s
observations to account for the time blocks without a count and
averaging over the different observers we get an estimate for the number
of participants at point <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \hat{N}_X = \frac{e_X}{k_X}
\sum_{j=1}^{k_X} \overline{Y}_X(a_X +
(j-1)c).\]</span></p>
<p>In most cases one would have that <span
class="math inline">\(e_X/k_X=c\)</span>. As an example: If a counter
counts 200 people for <em>every</em> 1-minute-counting-block during
two-hours, i.e. corresponding to 24 observations (one every five
minutes), her estimate for <span class="math inline">\(N_X\)</span>
would be 200<span class="math inline">\(\cdot\)</span> 24<span
class="math inline">\(\cdot\)</span> 5= 24000.</p>
<p>In order to adjust the estimate at point <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span> for people who joined the march after
point <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, we perform an independent
counting at point <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> and
additionally ask <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> people at point
<span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>, whether they marched past point
<span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> or not. Denoting <span
class="math inline">\(\hat{\phi}\)</span> the fraction of people
answering yes to this question the <strong>two on-the-spot counting
estimator</strong> is <span class="math display">\[
\hat{N} = \hat{N}_A + (1-\hat{\phi}) \hat{N}_B.
\]</span> Note that this estimator does not take into account that
people could potentially leave the march between <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span> and that its also possible to join the
march after <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>. However, the
proportion of such participants is assumed to be negligible.</p>
<p>A confidence interval (CI) based on an asymptotic normal assumption
can be obtained by deriving that <span class="math display">\[
\operatorname{se}(\hat{N}) =
\sqrt{\widehat{\operatorname{Var}}(\hat{N}_A) + (1-\hat{\phi})^2
\widehat{\operatorname{Var}}(\hat{N}_B) + \hat{N}_B^2
\frac{\hat{\phi}(1-\hat{\phi})}{m}},
\]</span> where we have used that <span class="math display">\[
\widehat{\operatorname{Var}}(\hat{N}_X) =
\frac{e_X^2}{k_X^2} \sum_{j=1}^{k_X}
\widehat{\operatorname{Var}}(\overline{Y}_X(a_X + (j-1)c)) =
\frac{e_X^2}{k_X^2} \sum_{j=1}^{k_X}
\frac{\widehat{\operatorname{Var}}(Y_X(a_X + (j-1)c))}{m_X}
\]</span> and <span class="math display">\[
\widehat{\operatorname{Var}}(Y_X(t)) =
\frac{1}{m_X-1}\sum_{i=1}^{m_X} (Y_{X,i}(t) - \overline{Y}_X(t)).
\]</span></p>
<p>A two-sided <span class="math inline">\((1-\alpha)\cdot
100\%\)</span> CI is then constructed as <span
class="math inline">\(\hat{N} \pm z_{1-\alpha/2}
\operatorname{se}(\hat{N})\)</span>, where <span
class="math inline">\(z_{1-\alpha/2}\)</span> is the <span
class="math inline">\(1-\alpha/2\)</span> quantile of the standard
normal distribution. To get a 95% CI the value is <span
class="math inline">\(z_{1-0.05/2}=1.96\)</span>. Since <span
class="math inline">\(N\)</span> is expected to be at least of moderate
size before one bothers counting this asymptotic CI should have decent
coverage.</p>
<h3 id="implementation-in-r">Implementation in R</h3>
<p>The above equations have been implemented as function
<code>two_on_the_spot_N</code> in R, which given a <code>counts</code>
data.frame computes the estimate and a corresponding confidence
interval. The <a
href="https://github.com/hoehleatsu/hoehleatsu.github.io/blob/master/_source/2017-05-04-crowdsize.Rmd">github
code of this post</a> contains the details.</p>

<p>Among 480 interviewed persons at point B, 437 reported to also have

<p>Our estimate for the number of participants is thus around 26400 with
a 95% confidence interval of 25600-27200. For comparison the authors
state that the Hong Kong Police’s estimate was around 28000, whereas the
organizers claimed a size of 58000.</p>
<h2 id="discussion">Discussion</h2>
<p>We were able to reproduce the results of <span class="citation"
data-cites="yip_etal2010">Yip et al. (2010)</span> using the article’s
data (up to some rounding issues). An R function is now available for
supporting mobile crowd estimation in the future. It will be interesting
to synthesize the traditional and easy to implement counting approach
described above with more modern data sources such as mobile phone or
twitter data <span class="citation" data-cites="botta_etal2015">(Botta,
